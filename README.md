## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase my skills in web development and provide a practical demonstration of a car rental booking system. It allows users to interact with the application by creating accounts, reserving cars, managing their reservations, and simulating the booking process from start to finish.


## Features

- <h2>User Registration and Authentication:</h2> Users can create accounts with secure authentication. This feature ensures data privacy and personalized experiences.

- <h2>Car Reservation:</h2> Users can browse available cars, select their preferred vehicle, specify rental dates, and complete the booking process. The application provides a seamless booking experience, including price calculation.

- <h2>Reservation Management:</h2> Users can view their current reservations, check booking details, and cancel reservations they no longer need. This feature demonstrates the ability to manage user data effectively.

- <h2>Responsive Design:</h2> The application is built with a responsive design to ensure optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- <h2>Database Integration:</h2> The backend of the application connects to a database to store user profiles, car information, and reservation data. It utilizes a relational database system to manage relationships between users and their reservations.

- <h2>Server-Side Logic:</h2> The backend of the application contains server-side logic for handling user authentication, reservation creation, and management. It also calculates booking prices based on user selections.

- <h2>Sending Otp Emails:</h2> The app is also capable to send email to users which consist of an OTP code to authenticate users.
